			lyrics: "
				Imagine there's no heaven
				It's easy if you try
				No hell below us
				Above us only sky
				Imagine all the people
				Living for today

				Imagine there's no countries
				It isn't hard to do
				Nothing to kill or die for
				And no religion too
				Imagine all the people
				Living life in peace

				You may say
				I'm a dreamer
				But I'm not the only one
				I hope some day
				You'll join us
				And the world will be as one

				Imagine no possessions
				I wonder if you can
				No need for greed or hunger
				A brotherhood of man
				Imagine all the people
				Sharing all the world

				You may say
				I'm a dreamer
				But I'm not the only one
				I hope some day
				You'll join us
				And the world will live as one

			lyrics: "
				In the town where I was born
				Lived a man who sailed the sea
				And he told us of his life
				In the land of submarines

				So we sailed on to the sun
				Till we found the sea of green
				And we lived beneath the waves
				In our yellow submarine

				We all live in a yellow submarine
				Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
				We all live in a yellow submarine
				Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

				And our friends are all aboard
				Many more of them live next door
				And the band begins to play

				We all live in a yellow submarine
				Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
				We all live in a yellow submarine
				Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

				As we live a life of ease
				Ev'ryone of us has all we need
				Sky of blue and sea of green
				In our yellow submarine

				We all live in a yellow submarine
				Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
				We all live in a yellow submarine
				Yellow submarine, yellow submarine",

			lyrics: "Oh, oh, oh
				Oh, oh, oh
				Oh, oh, oh
				Oh

				I’m waking up to ash and dust
				I wipe my brow and sweat my rust
				I’m breathing in the chemicals

				I’m breaking in, shaping up
				Then checking out on the prison bus
				This is it, the apocalypse

				Oh, oh

				I’m waking up
				I feel it in my bones
				Enough to make my system blow

				Welcome to the new age, to the new age
				Welcome to the new age, to the new age

				Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
				Oh, oh, oh, oh
				I'm radioactive, radioactive

				Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
				Oh, oh, oh, oh
				I'm radioactive, radioactive

				I raise my flag, and dye my clothes
				It’s a revolution, I suppose
				We’re painted red to fit right in

				Oh, oh

				I’m breaking in, shaping up
				Then checking out on the prison bus
				This is it, the apocalypse

				Oh, oh

				I’m waking up
				I feel it in my bones
				Enough to make my system blow

				Welcome to the new age, to the new age

				Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

				I'm radioactive, radioactive

				Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
				Oh, oh, oh, oh
				I'm radioactive, radioactive

				All systems go
				The sun hasn’t died
				Deep in my bones
				Straight from inside

				I’m waking up
				I feel it in my bones
				Enough to make my system blow

				Welcome to the new age, to the new age
				Welcome to the new age, to the new age

			title: "In the end",
			artist: "Linkin Park",
			lyrics: "
				It starts with
				One thing, I don't know why
				It doesn't even matter how hard you try
				Keep that in mind
				I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
				All I know
				Time is a valuable thing
				Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
				Watch it count down to the end of the day
				The clock ticks life away
				It's so unreal
				Didn't look out below
				Watch the time go right out the window
				Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
				I wasted it all
				just to watch you go
				I kept everything inside
				And even though I tried
				It all fell apart
				What it meant to me will eventually be a
				memory of a time when

				I tried so hard and got so far
				But in the end, it doesn't even matter
				I had to fall to lose it all
				But in the end it doesn't even matter

				One thing, I don't know why
				It doesn't even matter how hard you try
				Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to remind myself how
				I tried so hard
				In spite of the way you were mocking me
				Acting like I was part of your property
				Remembering all the times you fought with me
				I'm surprised it got so [far]
				Things aren't the way they were before
				You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
				Not that you knew me back then
				But it all comes back to me [in the end]
				I kept everything inside
				And even though I tried
				It all fell apart
				What it meant to me will eventually be a
				memory of a time when

				I tried so hard and got so far
				But in the end, it doesn't even matter
				I had to fall to lose it all
				But in the end it doesn't even matter

				I've put my trust in you
				Pushed as far as I can go
				for all this
				There's only one thing you should know

				I've put my trust in you
				Pushed as far as I can go
				for all this
				There's only one thing you should know

				I tried so hard and got so far
				But in the end, it doesn't even matter
				I had to fall to lose it all
				But in the end it doesn't even matter",

			artist: "Guns'n Roses",
			lyrics: "
				Welcome to the jungle we got fun and games
				We got everything you want honey, we know the names
				We are the people that can find whatever you may need
				If you got the money honey we got your disease

				In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
				Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees 
				I wanna watch you bleed

				Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day
				If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price you pay
				And you're a very sexy girl very hard to please
				You can taste the bright lights but you won't get there for free
				In the jungle welcome to the jungle
				Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
				I,I wanna hear you scream

				Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here everyday
				You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
				If you got a hunger for what you see you'll take it eventually
				You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me

				In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
				Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees
				I'm gonna watch you plead

				And when you're high you never ever want to come down
				So down, so down, so down, yeah

				You know where you are?
				You're in the jungle baby, you gonna dieee
				In the jungle welcome to the jungle
				Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees 
				In the jungle welcome to the jungle
				Feel my, my, my my serpentine
				Jungle welcome to the jungle
				Watch it bring you to your sha na na na na knees knees
				Down in the jungle welcome to the jungle
				Watch it bring you to you
				It's gonna bring you down, ha!!",
